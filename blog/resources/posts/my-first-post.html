<p> The Premier League is celebrating its 30th anniversary and while these celebrations contain brilliant stories of what has happened on the pitch, there are a wealth of tales to be told of the incredible impact the Premier League and its clubs have had in their local communities since the competition started in 1992.

That is why we are taking the Premier League Trophy on a seven-week tour of England and Wales, visiting Premier League, EFL, non-league and women's clubs who have benefited from Premier League investment.
    
Clubs across the football pyramid will name a Community Captain, to honour one of the many people who have been a part of the Premier League's success and had a positive impact on the lives of people connected to their football club.</p>

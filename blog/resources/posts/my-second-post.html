<p> Steven Gerrard will be asking his Villa players to show a lot more guile and invention when they host Everton in their first home match of 2022/23.
    
Despite enjoying the bulk of possession at AFC Bournemouth on the opening weekend, Villa laboured in possession and struggled to create quality chances in a 2-0 defeat.
    
Conceding two set-piece goals and mustering just 0.66xG from 15 attempts on goal, it was not the start to the new season that Gerrard and his players were looking for.
    
Villa have switched from a back three to a flat back four, but that did not stop full-backs Matty Cash and Lucas Digne from piling forward and supplying in their first fixture.
    
The right-flank was especially productive, with Cash and winger Leon Bailey delivering 15 open play crosses between them.
    
They were the most prolific crossers in open play across the Premier League's opening set of fixtures.
    
Digne on five, was also close to the top of that list.</p>
